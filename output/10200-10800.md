## Introduction to Tokenization in Language Models

In a recent lecture, the complexity of tokenization in large language models (LLMs) was discussed, emphasizing how these models perceive and generate text. Tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters into tokens, which are essentially the building blocks that language models understand and manipulate. 

## Tokens and Encoding

One key point made during the talk is that tokens often include spaces as prefixes. For instance, the token for " O" (space O) in GPT-3 is composed of space and the letter 'O', creating a single token:

```plaintext
(space O) -> Token 8840
```

When encoding strings, spaces can be individual tokens:

```plaintext
" " -> Token 220
```

This becomes significant because models rarely see data where a space starts a token unless it's part of another character, causing out-of-distribution issues when they encounter these scenarios.

## Issues with Partial Tokens

The lecture also shed light on the problems with partial tokens. For example, the model may never have seen a commonly grouped phrase like "default cell style" split into separate tokens:

```plaintext
"default cell style" -> Single Token
```

Splitting this into partial tokens can lead to errors because the model doesn't know how to handle or complete them, having never seen such an example in the training set.

## Tokenization Illustrated with Jupyter Notebooks

Several examples were given using a Jupyter notebook to visually explain the encoding process, how space characters are tokenized, and how breaking up common text phrases can lead to unexpected errors from the model.

### Code Snippet: Tokenizing a Text String

```python
text = " Hello world ðŸŒŽ"
val = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(val)
```

### Code Snippet: Dealing with Tokenization Errors

```python
attempt_text = "default cell st"
completion_result = model.predict_next_tokens(attempt_text)
```

## The Unstable Tokens Problem

Towards the end of the lecture, the concept of unstable tokens was introduced. Unstable tokens are partial tokens or split common text sequences that the model treats as out-of-distribution. The lecturer mentioned that there is a significant amount of code to handle these unstable tokens, despite the lack of documentation on this topic.

## Conclusion: The Intricacies of Tokenization

The discussion made it clear that tokenization is a crucial yet intricate part of how LLMs like GPT-3 function. Tokenization affects not only the text inputs but also how the model generates outputs. Dealing with out-of-distribution tokens, partial tokens, and unstable tokens remains a complex and "gnarly" issue for language models.

Stay tuned for more insights and potentially a full video on the topic of unstable tokens in the future.
