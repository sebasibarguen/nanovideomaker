# Understanding Tokenization in Language Models: Anomalies and Efficiency

### The Mystery of Solid Gold Magikarp
The phenomenon of odd token clusters in language models has become widely recognized, especially with the peculiar case documented in the "Solid Gold Magikarp" blog post. Here, a startling discovery was made: certain tokens, when queried, evoked erratic behavior from large language models (LLMs). This unusual behavior included evasion, hallucinations, insults, and even humor, deviating from expected model responses.

#### Emergence of Strange Tokens
- Tokens like "PatRot," "E-StreamFame," and "Solid Gold Magikarp" were found to form a cluster.
- Odd model responses included a variety of broken behaviors.
- Research suggested that these tokens are "trigger words" leading to a malfunction.

### The Cause Revealed: An Issue of Tokenization

#### Tokenization and Training Datasets Discrepancy
- "Solid Gold Magikarp" is identified as a Reddit user (u/Solid Gold Magikarp).
- The token representing this user was common in the tokenization dataset but absent from the language model training set.
- As a result, this token remained untrained and, when activated, led to undesired outcomes.

#### The Technical Explanation
- During the tokenization phase, common strings may get their own dedicated tokens.
- If these tokens don't appear in subsequent training, they never undergo the necessary optimization.
- They're akin to unallocated memory: When used, they introduce unpredictability because they lack any meaningful training.

### Token Efficiency Across Formats

#### Comparing JSON and YAML
It's imperative to consider the efficiency of tokens when working with different formats. JSON, for instance, is denser with tokens compared to YAML. Below is an illustration of their token consumption for the same content:

- JSON: 116 tokens
- YAML: 99 tokens

Understanding this can be vital for optimizing costs related to token use, be it the context length or the financial aspect.

### Python Code Snippets
The following code examples demonstrate aspects of tokenization in Python:

#### Example 1: Unicode Encoding
```python
# Encoding a Korean phrase
print([39594, 38712, ...], "Hello in Korean!".encode('utf-8'))
```

#### Example 2: Text Encoding and Decoding
```python
# Defining a Unicode string
text = "Any text here"

# Encoding the text and then decoding it
valnet = text.encode('utf-8')
print(valnet2.decode('utf-8'))
```

#### Example 3: Regular Expressions
```python
# Using regular expressions to find patterns
import re
pat = re.compile(r'[\w-]+')
print(pat.findall('1,2,3; Hello, how are you'))
```

### Conclusions
Exploring the quirks and oddities of tokenization offers valuable insights into the limitations and potential issues encountered in LLMs. Through examining real-world examples such as the "Solid Gold Magikarp" token anomaly, we uncover lessons in data train-test consistency and language model safety. Additionally, understanding token economics and format efficiencies is crucial for improving model performance and managing operational costs.
