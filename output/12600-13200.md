# Understanding Text Encoding and Byte-Pair Encoding in NLP

In this informative post, we dive into the nuances of text encoding with a focus on UTF-8, and explore how the byte-pair encoding algorithm works in the context of natural language processing (NLP).

## Text Encoding: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32

Text encoding is a fundamental aspect of processing text data in computers. Let's delve into the intricacies and compare UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

### UTF-8

UTF-8 is a widely accepted and versatile encoding format. When encoding a string into UTF-8, the result is a bytes object. However, to visually interpret the output more effectively, converting it into a list of raw bytes can provide clearer insights.

Example encoding a string into UTF-8 raw bytes in Python:
```python
text = "Hello in Korean!"
encoded_text = text.encode('utf-8')
list_of_bytes = list(encoded_text)
print(list_of_bytes)
```

### UTF-16
Moving on to UTF-16, we observe a byte stream pattern where many values are prefixed with zero bytes, indicating potential inefficiency. This is particularly evident with characters that could be represented in a simpler format, as seen with ASCII characters.

### UTF-32
With UTF-32, the inefficiencies become more pronounced. Sequences are padded with a considerable number of zero bytes, leading to even greater wastefulness.

### Efficiency Matters
Given these insights, it's clear that UTF-8 is preferable for many applications due to its efficiency with most character sets. However, directly using UTF-8 byte streams is not ideal for language models, as the limited vocabulary size can lead to overly long sequences and inefficient processing.

## Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

To mitigate the issues associated with raw UTF-8 byte streams, we turn to the byte-pair encoding algorithm, which helps compress the byte sequences while retaining the flexibility of tuning vocabulary size.

### The Concept of BPE
Byte-pair encoding is an iterative compression technique that efficiently reduces sequence length and increases vocabulary size.

BPE Example Workflow:

1. Start with an input sequence of tokens or bytes.
2. Identify the pair of tokens that occur most frequently.
3. Mint a new token representing the frequent pair and add it to the vocabulary.
4. Replace all instances of that token pair with the newly created token.
5. Repeat the process as needed to compress the sequence to a desired level.

This approach effectively reduces the number of tokens, and in turn, the sequence length, while expanding the vocabulary to include more complex token combinations.

## Language Models and Raw Byte Sequences

The idea of feeding raw byte sequences into language models without tokenization is both intriguing and challenging. A hierarchical structuring of the transformer model has been proposed to work around the computational intensiveness of processing long sequences. Although the concept holds promise, it has not yet been widely adopted or proven at scale.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while UTF-8 remains a favored encoding standard, efficient text processing in language models requires smart compression techniques like byte-pair encoding. While the notion of using raw bytes in models is captivating, for now, BPE remains an essential tool in the NLP practitioner's toolkit.
