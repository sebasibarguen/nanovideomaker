# Introduction to Byte-Pair Encoding

Tokenization is a crucial pre-processing step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for building language models. In this lecture, we explored the concept of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and how it can be used to efficiently tokenize text data.

## Why Use Longer Texts?

- Using longer text provides more representative statistics for byte pairs.
- Longer samples yield more sensible results as they better capture the language structure and usage.

## Encoding and Merging Process

### Raw Text Encoding

1. Convert raw text into bytes using UTF-8 encoding.
2. Convert the raw bytes to a list of integers for easy manipulation in Python.

```python
# Example of encoding text to bytes, then to a list of integers
text = "Hello, world!"
encoded_bytes = text.encode('utf-8')
integer_list = list(encoded_bytes)
```

### Merging of Byte Pairs

- The goal is to create a final vocabulary for the tokenizer with a certain size, which is a hyperparameter for performance.
- We create a `mergers` dictionary to track child pairings and new token associations.
- The process simulates a 'forest' of merges rather than a traditional binary tree, starting from the leaves (individual bytes).

```python
# Pseudo-code capturing the idea of the merging process
final_vocab_size = 276
tokens_list = list(original_tokens)
mergers = {}

for i in range(20):  # Perform 20 merges
    # Find common pair
    # Mint new token
    # Replace occurrences
    # Record merger
```

### Example Merging Output

- The first merge combined tokens 101 and 32 into a new token 256.
- The last (20th) merge combined tokens 256 and 259 into a new token 275.
- Merger output detailed each step, showing the evolution of the token list.

```python
# Output example (truncated)
Merging pair (101, 32) into new token 256
...
Merging pair (256, 259) into new token 275
```

## Achieving Compression

- We started with 24,000 bytes and after 20 merges reduced it to 19,000 tokens.
- The compression ratio achieved is approximately 1.27.

```python
compression_ratio = original_byte_count / final_token_count
```

## Tokenizer Training

- The tokenizer functions independently from any larger language model (LLM).
- Training the tokenizer happens on a separate set of documents.
- The tokenizer uses its own byte encoding algorithm, distinct from the LLM's processes.

# Visualizing the Connection Between Tokenizer and LLM

The tokenizer acts as an isolated object with its own responsibilities distinct from the LLM. A diagram can illustrate the flow from raw text to tokenized input, ready for the LLM.

# Conclusion

Byte-Pair Encoding is a nuanced yet effective method for tokenizer training, allowing customization of vocabulary size and understanding the dynamics of language patterns. Our practical session detailed how to perform the encoding and discussed how to optimize tokenizer performance for better NLP results.
