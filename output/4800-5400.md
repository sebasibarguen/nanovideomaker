# Understanding GPT Tokenization and Special Tokens

## Introduction

In the realm of natural language processing, tokenization plays a pivotal role in preparing text data for language models such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). This blog post aims to explain the concept of tokenization, the role of special tokens, and their significance in the context of GPT models, drawing from a lecture on the subject.

## Tokenization and Special Tokens

Language models like GPT are designed to work with a limited vocabulary of tokens. These tokens are numerical representations of text units that range between specific values, typically from 0 up to around 50,256 for GPT models. To structure and differentiate documents during training, a special token known as the "end of text" token is introduced. Its purpose is to signal the conclusion of one document and the commencement of another, unrelated piece of text.

### How it Works:
- Between documents, the "end of text" token is inserted.
- The language model needs to learn that this token indicates it should reset any context from the previous document.
- Special tokens are explicitly handled by the tokenizer and are not part of the regular byte pair encoding (BPE) merges.

## The GPT-2 Tokenizer Code

Examining the GPT-2 tokenizer code reveals insights into how these special tokens are integrated. The tokenizer assigns different tokens to text but recognizes and allocates a specific token (50,256) for the "end of text" marker.

### Understanding Special Tokens:
- Special tokens are not part of the BPE merges in the encoding process.
- The tokenizer includes special case instructions to manage these tokens.
- While absent in the `encoder.py` file, the handling can be observed in libraries like Tick Token, which is written in Rust.

## Delimiting Conversations

Special tokens become increasingly important when fine-tuning language models for tasks like conversation handling, as seen in versions of GPT such as ChatGPT. Conversations between an assistant and a user are segmented using tokens that mark the start and end of messages.

### Use Case:
- Tokens like `imstart`, `imend`, etc., help delimit conversations and maintain the flow of communication.

## Extending Tick Token

The Tick Token library provides the capability to extend and customize tokenization. Users can fork base tokenizers, add arbitrary special tokens, and ensure the library swaps them correctly during processing.

### Customization Steps:
- Fork base tokenizers like those in GPT-4.
- Add new special tokens with unique IDs.

## Model Surgery and Embeddings

When introducing new special tokens, adjustments to the model's structure, often referred to as "model surgery," are necessary. This includes altering the embedding matrix to accommodate the additional tokens by adding new rows initialized with small random numbers.

### Token Embeddings:
- Extending the embedding matrix for each new token.
- Initializing new rows with random values to represent the token in vector space.

## Summary

The tokenization process, facilitated by tokenizers like the GPT-2 and GPT-4, utilizes special tokens to manage and organize textual data effectively. These tokens instruct the language model on how to separate different pieces of text, especially in applications involving conversation. Moreover, the flexibility of extending tokenization through libraries like Tick Token allows for customization, supporting a range of tasks and fine-tuning requirements.
