# Understanding and Building a GPT-4 Tokenizer: A Guide to Tokenization in Large Language Models

In this blog post, we will delve into the intricacies of building a tokenizer for a GPT-4 model, exploring some key concepts and code examples that will equip you with the knowledge to develop your own tokenizer. We will also discuss the differences in tokenizing strategies between two primary libraries, TicToken and SentencePiece.

## Adding Special Tokens to GPT Models

When training or fine-tuning large language models like GPT-4, one may need to add special tokens. This process requires alterations on two levels:

1. **Tokenization Changes**:
   - Extending the tokenizer by adding the new token.
   - Modifying the tokenizer to recognize and handle the special token.

2. **Model Surgery**:
   - Adjusting the final layer of the transformer to account for the new token.
   - Ensuring the projection to the classifier includes the new token.

Such an operation is commonly performed to adapt base models to specialized tasks, such as creating a chatbot like ChatGPT.

## Developing Your Own GPT-4 Tokenizer

The speaker has shared a resource, the MinBPE repository, which contains code examples to help you craft your own tokenizer. This code is publicly accessible and intended as a reference for your experimentation.

### Exercise Progression Suggestion

Follow the outlined exercise progression laid out on MinBPE.org, broken down into four steps towards building a GPT-4 tokenizer. Use the repository as a resource for guidance and troubleshooting.

### Key Behaviors to Replicate

- **Encoding**: Encode a string and receive a predicted token sequence.
- **Decoding**: Decode the token sequence to recreate the original string.
- **Training Function**: Implement a custom training function to develop your own token vocabularies.

## MinBPE's Token Vocabulary Insights

Here is a glimpse into some visualized tokenizer training outcomes with MinBPE:

- **GPT-4 Merges**: A visualization of token merges during GPT-4's training. Example: combining two spaces into one token.
- **Comparison with Taylor Swift's Wikipedia Page**: MinBPE was trained using this page, highlighting the similarities and differences between custom training and GPT-4's tokens based on the training dataset.

## TicToken to SentencePiece Transition

SentencePiece is a library that is frequently used in large language models for tokenization. It has certain advantages over libraries like TicToken:

- It can perform both token vocabulary training and inference.
- It efficiently supports byte pair encoding (BPE).
- It is utilized by other notable models such as Llama and Mistral.

### How SentencePiece Differs

SentencePiece operates directly at the code point level rather than converting code points to bytes first. This changes the order of operations and can lead to different outcomes in tokenization.

## Code Examples

Throughout the lecture, various code snippets were shown that illustrate the implementation details of the discussed concepts:

- **Encoding/Decoding Strings**:
  ```python
  # Example Python code to demonstrate encoding and decoding
  encoded_string = "some text to encode".encode("utf-8")
  decoded_string = encoded_string.decode("utf-8")
  ```

- **Training with SentencePiece**:
  ```python
  # Import SentencePiece library
  import sentencepiece as spm
  
  # Train SentencePiece model
  spm.SentencePieceTrainer.Train('--input=my_text_file.txt --model_prefix=m --vocab_size=32000')
  ```

- **Visualizing Merges**:
  ```python
  # Python code to visualize the merges in token vocabularies
  visualize_merges()
  ```

## Conclusion

Tokenization plays a critical role in the functioning of large language models. By understanding the principles behind it and studying code examples from resources like MinBPE, developers and researchers can customize their tokenizers to better suit their projects. As we continue to explore differing approaches by tools like TicToken and SentencePiece, the field becomes ever more versatile, paving the way for more nuanced and effective language processing models.
