# Understanding Tokenization with SentencePiece

Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP), which involves breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or subwords. In this lecture, we explore how to use SentencePiece, a robust and language-independent tokenizer that uses a data-driven approach to generate a vocabulary and encode texts.

## What is SentencePiece?

SentencePiece is a toolkit that allows you to tokenize and detokenize texts. It is often used in machine translation and other NLP applications due to its flexibility and the ability to efficiently both train and infernce BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) or Unigram Language Models.

## SentencePiece in NLP Models

### Special Tokens
- **UNCTOKEN**: A mandatory token in SentencePiece.
- **Beginning of Sentence (BOS)** and **End of Sentence (EOS)** tokens.
- **PADTOKEN**: An optional padding token.

### Training SentencePiece
When trained, the model generates:
- `.model` file: Contains the trained model.
- `.vocab` file: Contains the vocabulary with tokens and their IDs.

### Vocabulary Composition
The vocabulary in SentencePiece follows a certain structure:
1. Special tokens (e.g., UNCTOKEN, BOS, EOS)
2. Byte tokens (`fallback=True`)
3. Merge tokens (parent nodes)
4. Individual code point tokens

Tokens are added to the vocabulary if they appear frequently enough in the training set, while rare code points are excluded.

### Byte Fallback Mechanism
When `byte_fallback` is enabled, SentencePiece can handle unseen characters (code points) by representing them using byte-level encoding. If disabled, rare characters will map to an unknown token (`UNK`).

## Encoding and Decoding Example
Encoding transforms raw text into a sequence of token IDs. Decoding reverses the process, converting token IDs back into text. The lecture demonstrates this with an encoding and decoding example using SentencePiece.

## Practical Example: Encoding "Hello" and "Annyeonghaseyo"
The lecturer presented an example where the phrase "Hello, annyeonghaseyo" (the latter being a Korean greeting) is tokenized:
- For characters part of the training set, SentencePiece assigns specific token IDs.
- Korean characters, not seen during training, are assigned byte-level tokens (thanks to the `byte_fallback`=True setting).

When `byte_fallback` is disabled and the model is retrained, the by tokens are removed, and the Korean string, being unrecognized, is represented by the `UNK` token ID, which is zero.

## Conclusion
The discussed tokenization approach is crucial for handling various languages and character sets in NLP tasks, making models more robust and capable of handling tokens unseen during training. SentencePiece's capability to encode unknown characters as byte-level tokens ensures that character-level information is retained, which could be critical for language models' performance.

Lastly, Yannic highlighted that while byte fallback is beneficial, there may be instances where it's disabled, leading all rare or unknown sequences to map to a single unknown token, which is undesirable for language modeling.
