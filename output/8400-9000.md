# Introduction to Vocabulary Size in Transformers

When designing transformer models for natural language processing tasks, one critical hyperparameter to consider is the vocabulary size. Why does this matter, and what are the implications of increasing the vocabulary?

## The Challenge of Scaling Vocabulary Size
- **Computational Expense:** Larger vocabularies mean larger token embedding tables and linear layers, increasing the computational cost, especially in the final layer where probabilities for each token are calculated.
- **Undertraining Concerns:** With a larger number of tokens, each appears less frequently in the data, potentially resulting in undertrained token vectors due to infrequent participation in the training process.
- **Sequence Compression:** As vocabulary size grows, text sequences get shorter since more text is represented by fewer tokens, but this could lead to insufficient processing of the compressed information by the transformer's forward pass.

State-of-the-art models typically have vocabularies in the high tens of thousands, up to around 100,000 tokens.

## Extending Pre-trained Model Vocabulary
When fine-tuning, such as with chat GPT-like models, there may be a need to extend vocabulary with special tokens to handle new functions or metadata. This requires:
- Resizing the token embedding matrix and the LM head linear layer.
- Adding new embeddings and corresponding parameters from scratch (initialized to small random numbers).
- Performing minor model "surgery" where only the new parameters related to the new tokens might be trained, while the rest of the model may remain frozen.

## Exploring the Design Space: GIST Tokens
An example of vocabulary design innovation is the introduction of "GIST tokens". These tokens compress long prompts into shorter ones that represent the same information, optimized through distillation, where only the new token embeddings are trained. This technique maintains the model's performance while significantly reducing prompt sizes.

# Hands-On Tokenization Techniques

Tokenization is the first step in turning raw text into something a transformer model can understand. Below are some examples of tokenization techniques:

## Basic Tokenization
```python
# Tokenization of an English phrase
text = "Hello, world!"
encoded_text = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
print(encoded_text)
```

## Advanced Tokenization Concepts
- **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** To encode arbitrary new words, BPE uses a large but finite vocabulary of subword units based on the most common substrings.
- **Unigram Language Modeling:** This probabilistic model outputs a distribution over different possible segmentations of a sentence, considering the likelihood of each sequence.

## Tokenization with SentencePiece
SentencePiece is a tokenization library that directly operates on raw Unicode strings and employs pieces (tokens) that efficiently tokenize both common and rare words.

```python
text = "안녕하세요 (Hello in Korean!)".encode('utf-8')
tokens = sentencepiece.encode_as_pieces(text)
print(tokens)
```

## Regular Expressions and Unicode Tokenization
Encoding and decoding operations such as regular expressions can be used to split text into tokens, including characters and special symbols in Unicode:

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'[\w]+|[\s]+|[^\w\s]+')
matches = pattern.findall(text)
print(matches)
```

# Conclusion

The choice of vocabulary size and tokenization strategy in transformer models impacts performance, efficiency, and the model's ability to generalize to new tasks and domains. By understanding these concepts and how to adjust parameters effectively, you can enhance model functionality without sacrificing its core capabilities.
