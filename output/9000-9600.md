## Introduction
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have expanded the use cases of transformer models to process multiple modalities such as text, images, videos, and audio. The ability to handle various input types without significant changes to the architecture has been a key focus. This article breaks down how transformers can tokenize inputs across these modalities and some of the challenges faced in processing and predicting them.

## Multimodal Tokenization
Transformers, originally designed for text, are now adept at dealing with other data types. By tokenizing inputs, such as converting images into a series of tokens, these models can handle complex tasks across different modalities. Here's how it's done:

- **Images**: Images are split into patches, which are then tokenized into integers. In some cases, hard tokens represent discrete values, while soft tokens represent continuous values processed through models like autoencoders.

- **Videos**: Similar to images, video frames can be truncated into tokens, accommodating vocabularies for various video segments.

- **Audio**: While not covered in the transcript, audio can also be processed by transformers through tokenization, allowing models to work with waveform samples or spectral features.

### Example from OpenAI's Sora:
OpenAI’s Sora has extended this concept further by introducing tokenization for videos, demonstrating the potential of transformers in processing visual data and the seamless transition from text to visual patches.

## Tokenization and Its Impact on Model Performance

### Spell Checking and Tokenization:
- The transformer's ability to spell or perform character-level tasks can be affected by the length of tokens. For example, `.defaultstyle` is a token in GPT-4, which can complicate the model's understanding of individual characters within the token.

### Experiment with `.defaultstyle`:
- Asking the number of letter 'L's in `.defaultstyle` tripped up GPT-4 due to its tokenization.
- However, when listing out each character and then reversing the list, the model correctly processed the task, highlighting the importance of token representation.

## Challenges in Multilingual Tokenization
LLMs (Large Language Models) struggle with non-English languages because of:

- **Limited Non-English Data**: There's a lower quantity of non-English data during the model's training process.
- **Tokenization for Non-English Languages**: Inefficient tokenizer training on non-English languages can affect language model performance.

### Example of Token Inefficiency:
- Tokenization in English is often more efficient compared to other languages; for instance, `hello` is a single token, but its Korean equivalent `안녕하세요` splits into three tokens.

## Practical Demonstration using Python
To illustrate how tokenization impacts transformer models, Python code snippets were shared:

```python
# Example code snippet to tokenize a Korean phrase
tokens = [8349, ... , 4958]
```

```python
# Code snippet to demonstrate the impracticality of regular expressions in tokenizer
import re
regex = re.compile(r'[\w\']+|[.,!?;]')
```

```python
# Code snippet processing sentence tokenization
sentencepiece_processor.encode_as_ids("Text to tokenize")
```

The provided Python code snippets demonstrate different aspects of tokenization, such as how tokens map to unicode characters and how tokenizers can sometimes misinterpret data.

## Conclusion
Understanding the nuances of tokenization in transformer models is key to improving their abilities to process various data modalities and languages. By exploring the tokenization process, we gain insights into the potential limitations and areas for improvement. As demonstrated, simple adjustments in data representation can dramatically impact model performance and understanding.
